# Agarian-2.github.io
An experimental client for my MultiOgar server.

Things to note:
 - This client can be used for most MultiOgar-based servers.
 - Skins are broken at the moment.
 - I usually don't check this enough to be in a position to help issues and/or answer questions.
 - This client is NOT owned by me (the original is located at https://github.com/Luka967/Cigar).
 - Updates sometimes happen, but don't count on it.
 - This client works best with my MultiOgar server, located at https://github.com/agarian-2/MultiOgar.

What's new (mostly options):
 - Option to hide cell borders.
 - Option to hide grid.
 - Option for infinite mouse scroll zoom.
 - Option for transparent cells.
